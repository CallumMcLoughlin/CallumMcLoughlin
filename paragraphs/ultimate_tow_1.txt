I designed, wrote, and deployed the website ultimatetow.co.nz. UltimateTow is a website advertising towing services, alongside having the ability to contact the company directly for a quote on the "Contact Us" page
using the provided quote form. Alongside setting up the website itself, I also set up their email, using the @ultimatetow.co.nz domain and a backend invoicing system for ease
of generating invoice PDFs to be sent out to customers. The quote form system uses Google Recaptcha to prevent bots and spam, with valid quote requests being sent to a quote request inbox. 

The website was written with Nuxt.js for the frontend alongside ASP.Net for the backend. 
The website is hosted in a set of docker containers including Nginx for frontend, Certbot for SSL/TLS certificate, and ASP.Net for the backend.
