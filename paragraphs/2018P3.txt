This simulation was written in C# using the Monogame framework
which is a continuation of Microsoft's XNA framework. This was 
to teach myself the framework and have a little fun simulating
things.

The Monogame framework itself is not an engine, but purely a library to show
graphics, which required me to build an engine on top.
