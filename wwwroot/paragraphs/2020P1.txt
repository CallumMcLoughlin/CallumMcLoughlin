Written in Unity, this was a mobile app I made within two days. 
This project was a way that I could learn and develop good practices of 
Game Design, by using object pools rather than instantiation on the fly.

This project originally was meant to help me learn and develop shaders 
but due to the constraint of mobile had to be deferred for a project
at a later date that was not on the mobile platform.
