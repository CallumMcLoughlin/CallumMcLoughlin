This was a project intended for me to learn the fundamentals of the MVC design pattern alongside
Java with JavaFX/BootstrapFX, the Maven build process and JUnit automated testing.

This project incorporates the fundamentals of MVC data binding to create a way to visualize different
searching algorithms for different user drawn mazes.
